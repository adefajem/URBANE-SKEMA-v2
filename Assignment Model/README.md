**Model Description:**

This model solves the problem of assigning packages to micro-hubs and last milers in order to minimize the emissions associated with their routes. It also solves the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) for each last-miler to get the total distance travelled, as well as the total emissions generated, by each last-miler. (The assignments are the most important output, as it is expected that each last miler will perform their own routing.)

**Input Files:**

1. The original city_network_training_config file. This file contains:
    1. the locations of possible last-mile depots, micro-hubs and historical parcel destinations. origin and destination for each parcel to be delivered,
    2. information on number of possible last-milers and number of vehicles they have,
    3. time-violation penalty which controls the degree to which time window may be violated by the last-milers,
    4. the electricity generation breakdown for the city,
    5. the battery capacity if the electric delivery vehicles being used, and
    6. the number of training points to be generated.
2. The learned constraint file
3. The problem instance file (e.g. test_input_1). This file contains the information specifically related to the problem instance such as number of last-milers, micro-hubs and packages in this problem instance.

**Outputs:**

For the given problem instance, the output file contains:

1. The assignments of packages to lockers
2. The assignment of packages to last milers
3. The total distance (in kilometres) travelled by each last miler
4. The total emissions (in gCO2eq) generated by each last miler
5. The package arrival times
